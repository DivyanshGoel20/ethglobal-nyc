Chain Support
OpenSea MCP supports all of the blockchains supported on the OpenSea web front-end.

When using tools, you can specify the chain parameter to filter results to a specific blockchain.

Best Practices
Use natural language - The AI-powered search understands context, so describe what you're looking for naturally
Combine tools - Get comprehensive insights by using multiple tools together
Specify chains - When looking for specific blockchain data, include the chain name
Check balances first - Before requesting swap quotes, verify wallet has sufficient tokens
Use collection slugs - For specific collections, use their OpenSea slug (e.g., 'boredapeyachtclub')
Leverage includes parameters - Many tools support optional 'includes' arrays for additional data (activity, analytics, offers, etc.)
Specify amounts correctly - For swaps, use native units (ETH/SOL) not smallest units (wei/lamports)
