# Waterfall

Waterfall is a project that helps bring NFT data to life by combining the power of AI agents, decentralized datasets, and blockchain technology.  

At its core, Waterfall uses **fetch.ai** agents to connect with the **OpenSea MCP Server**, which allows the platform to fetch real-time details about NFTs and tokens. This data is not just collected—it is transformed into structured datasets that are published through **Ocean Protocol**, enabling developers, collectors, and builders to purchase, share, and reuse this information in their own applications.  

To ensure transparency and trust, Waterfall also integrates with blockchain smart contracts. The deployed smart contract for the project can be found at:

Waterfall is designed to make NFT data more accessible, reliable, and engaging. By combining AI-powered data collection, decentralized storage, and on-chain validation, it creates a bridge between raw blockchain data and real-world applications. Whether it’s analyzing NFT collections, building new apps, or enabling creative experiences, Waterfall aims to turn NFT data into something both useful and impactful.
